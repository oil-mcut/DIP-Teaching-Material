    "handle various programming tasks such as numerical computation,\n",
    "web development, database programming, network programming,\n",
    "parallel processing, etc.\n",
    "Python is popular for various reasons including:\n",
    "1. It is free.\n",
    "2. It is available on all the popular operating systems such as\n",
    "Windows, Mac or Linux.\n",
    "3. It is an interpreted language. Hence, programmers can test\n",
    "portions of code on the command line before incorporating it\n",
    "into their program. There is no need for compiling or linking.\n",
    "4. It gives the ability to program faster.\n",
    "5. It is syntactically simpler than C/C++/Fortran. Hence it is\n",
    "highly readable and easier to debug.\n",
    "6. It comes with various modules that are standard or can be\n",
    "installed in an existing Python installation. These modules\n",
    "can perform various tasks like reading and writing various\n",
    "files, scientific computation, visualization of data, etc.\n",
    "7. Programs written in Python can be run on various OS or\n",
    "platforms with little or no change.\n",
    "8. It is a dynamically typed language. Hence the data type of\n",
    "variables does not have to be declared prior to their use,\n",
    "making it easier for people with less coding experience.\n",
    "9. It has a dedicated developer and user community and is kept\n",
    "up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Python has many advantages that have made it one of the\n",
    "most popular interpreted languages, it has a couple of drawbacks that\n",
    "are discussed below:\n",
    "1. Since its focus is on the ability to program faster, the speed of\n",
    "execution suffers. A Python program might be 10 times or\n",
    "more slower (say) than an equivalent C program, but it will\n",
    "contain fewer lines of code and can be programmed to handle\n",
    "multiple data types easily. This drawback in the Python code\n",
    "can be overcome by converting the computationally intensive\n",
    "portions of the code to C/C++ or by the appropriate use of\n",
    "data structure and modules.\n",
    "2. Indentation of the code is not optional. This makes the code\n",
    "readable. However, a code with multiple loops and other\n",
    "constructs will be indented to the right, making it difficult to\n",
    "read the code."
